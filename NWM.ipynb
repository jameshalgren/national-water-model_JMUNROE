    "I was listening to the news tonight and learned that Dallas, TX is currently experiencing significant flooding.  For example, the Washington Post reports:\n",

    "\n",
    "> In some isolated areas, the rainfall totals would be considered a 1-in-1,000-year flood — a remarkable reversal given the dramatic drought that Dallas had faced for months. Several rainfall gauges recorded more than 10 inches. A record-breaking 3.01 inches of rain was also recorded in one hour at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The downpour marked the latest such flood in the past few weeks across the United States. In one week alone, three 1-in-1,000-year rain events occurred, inundating St. Louis, eastern Kentucky and southeastern Illinois. The term, often considered controversial in part because it’s misunderstood, is used to describe a rainfall event that is expected once every 1,000 years, meaning it has just a 0.1 percent chance of happening in any given year — but such events can occur much more frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ...\n",
    "\n",
    "> One rain gauge in Harris County, Tex., tallied more than 14.9 inches of rain within just a 12-hour period, more than 40 percent of the area’s yearly rainfall, according to Jeff Lindner, a meteorologist for the county. Such rates of precipitation are nearly impossible for soils — not to mention impervious paved surfaces — to absorb without runoff that can cause flash flooding."
